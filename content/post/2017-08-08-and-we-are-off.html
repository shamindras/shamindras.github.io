<h2>Welcome - Letâ€™s Get Statistical!</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ve decided to start blogging to document my learning and development in statistics as a new graduate student. Iâ€™d like it just to be a fun place to document fun things I like to read about in the statistics, machine learning space and anything else I am into e.g.Â books, cricket (the Australian baseball), bad (i.e.Â dad) puns etcâ€¦</p>
<p>Feel free to pull up a chair and join me and we can explore statistics together!</p>
