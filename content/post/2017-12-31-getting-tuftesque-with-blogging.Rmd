## The tuftesque blogdown theme

[Nick Strayer](http://nickstrayer.me) and [Lucy D'Agostino McGowan](http://lucymcgowan.com) created the awesome [tuftesque blogdown theme](https://github.com/LFOD/real-blog/tree/master/themes/tuftesque) upon 
which this blog is based. 

I decided to finally bite the bullet and start
my blog with this wonderful theme. See [credits]() for more details and
additional sources of inspiration.

## Going 'full tufte'

Nick and Lucy already wrote a [blogpost already](http://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/07/13/introducing-the-tuftesque-blogdown-theme/) detailing the process to get started with `blogdown` and 
the `tuftesque` theme. Please check it out as it is much likely 
to be more thorough than the instructions I've listed below.

I've added a bit more detail on how to launch your blog using [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and also setting up HTTPS and buying your
own domain from Google domains (and syncing with netlify). I've repeated
some of the common blogdown instructions to keep it all together.

## Instructions - your own tuftesque blog

1. You will need to install pandoc. Follow the official [installation instructions](http://pandoc.org/installing.html)

On Mac I just ran the following in the terminal (after installing [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
brew install pandoc
```

2. Open up Rstudio and install the [blogdown package](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) by running:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")
library(blogdown)
```

3. Install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) by running:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::install_hugo()
```

4. Initialize a new blog using blogdown by running:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::new_site()
```

You should now see a new basic website appear in the RStudion viewer pane - yay
for us!

Now you can hit cancel in the Rstudio console pane `r emo::ji("stop_sign")`. 
This will stop the current site from being served (i.e. rendered live) in the 
html viewer pane in RStudio. I know it feels lame to shut it off so soon, 
but we are just getting started here!

5. Load the `tufteesque` theme. This is the moment you have all been waiting for
`r emo::ji("rainbow")`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::install_theme('nstrayer/tuftesque')
```

6. Re-load the site to check the theme is updated:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::serve_site()
```

7. Build site including all `Rmd` files - use method = "html"

When you 
This will knit the `Rmd` files into `html`
See [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/methods.html) for more details
```{r, eval=FALSE}
`blogdown::build_site(local = FALSE, method = c("html"))`
```

8. Create the gitignore file so that we commit only the relevant 
files for blogdown purposes. 

In the terminal run the following to create the `gitignore` file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
touch .gitignore
```

Inside the `gitignore` file using your favorite editor (i.e. `emacs` of course)
you can paste the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Blogdown common gitignore files
# Source: https://github.com/rbind/yihui/blob/master/.gitignore
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
public
static/figures
blogdown

# Source: https://github.com/kbroman/blog/blob/source/.gitignore
_cache/
drafts/

# DS_Store files

public/.DS_Store
public/css/.DS_Store
public/images/.DS_Store
themes/tuftesque/.DS_Store
themes/tuftesque/data/.DS_Store
themes/tuftesque/exampleSite/.DS_Store
themes/tuftesque/layouts/.DS_Store
themes/tuftesque/static/.DS_Store
themes/tuftesque/static/css/.DS_Store
themes/tuftesque/static/images/.DS_Store
```

Inside the gitignore you should paste the following
See [here](https://github.com/shamindras/ss_personal_blog/blob/master/.gitignore) for the most up to date version of this file. I borrowed the gitignore contents from [Yihui Xie's](https://github.com/rbind/yihui/blob/master/.gitignore) and [Karl Broman's](https://github.com/rbind/yihui/blob/master/.gitignore) setups.

If there is a more elegant way to recursively remove the mac `DS_Store` files 
from the `gitignore` please leave a comment below `r emo::ji("smile")`.

9. Build your awesome website!

Build site - use `method = "html"` in the `build_site` function. This will 
knit the `Rmd` files into `html` which does not happen by default.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::build_site(local = FALSE, method = c("html"))
```

You can also rerun `blogdown::serve_site()` to view the rendered site in the 
RStudio viewer pane. Now you should see the 3 default posts rendered tuftestyle
in your blog. The site will continue to render automatically in `Rstudio` as you save any local changes.

10. Add and commit all of the git files and push to github

```{r, eval=FALSE}
git add -A
git commit -m "FIX: Create first (default tufte-esque) blog, with gitignore"
git push origin master
```


11. _Optional:_ Install the `tufte` package

This is useful later when you start writing awesome blog posts and writing those
sweet margin notes like a boss `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`!

`r tufte::margin_note(stringr::str_c(emo::ji("v"), "Some cool marginalia here", sep = " "))`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tufte")
```

12. _Deploying your blog:_ Create a `netlify` account.

You've put in all this effort to setup your blog, now you are itching to send
it out into the world `r emo::ji("grin")`! Per [Yihui et. al.'s book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html) it is recommended that you use [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/). First start by creating
a netlify account. Sign-up is free.

13. _Deploying your blog:_ Buy a domain. For example I bought `www.shamindras.com` from [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com) for `$12/yr`

14. _Deploying your blog:_ Login to [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and select `New Site from Git`.

</div>
</div>

15. _Deploying your blog:_ Let netlify know that you would like to do continuous deployment from a particular cloud based version control platform. For this blog we use Github, so select that.

16. _Deploying your blog:_ Give `netlify` the necessary Github permissions to do continuous deployment

<div class="caption">

</div>
</div>
</div>

17. _Deploying your blog:_ Select `Create a new site` and select the github repo upon which your site is based. In my this is [the blog repo](https://github.com/shamindras/ss_personal_blog).

</img></a>
<div class="caption">
<p>Screenshot: Select the specific Github repo for your blog to link to netlify</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

18. _Deploying your blog:_ Setup the continuous deployment settings for your website on netlify. This means that everytime you make changes i.e. `push` and `merge` to the linked Github repo, `netlify` will automatically refresh your website! How `r emo::ji("cool")` is that!

</img></a>
<div class="caption">

</div>
</div>
</div>

19. _Deploying your blog:_ Setup your custom domain. `netlify` gives you a default domain name. This can be changed by selecting `Edit your custom domain` in personal settings. For this website this is set to `www.shamindras.com`.
